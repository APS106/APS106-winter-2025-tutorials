    "    - The system should be initialized with the name of the movie and the total number of tickets available.\n",
    "    - The number of reserved tickets should be initially set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reserve Ticket**:\n",
    "    - The system should allow users to reserve a certain number of tickets for a movie.\n",

    "3. **Cancel Reservation**:\n",
